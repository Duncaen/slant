.Sh NAME
.Nm slant-cgi
.Nd CGI program returning slant data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm slant-cgi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility produces system statistics as recorded by
.Xr slant-collectd 8 .
It interfaces with the database by default in
.Pa /var/www/data/slant.db .
.Pp
The CGI program accepts HTTP GET requests for the
.Pa /index.json
resource, which has the aliases
.Pa /index ,
.Pa / ,
or the empty request.
Other resources return an HTTP code 404.
Non-GET request return an HTTP code 405.
Other (non-200) codes are possible and follow standard definitions.
.Pp
On success,
.Nm
returns an HTTP code 200 and a valid JSON document.
This consists of the following:
.Bd -literal
{ qmin: [ records... ],
   min: [ records... ],
  hour: [ records... ],
   day: [ records... ],
  week: [ records... ],
  year: [ records... ] }
.Ed
.Pp
These are the possibly-empty sets of records accumulated over a given
interval of time in quarter-minute quanta.
So each
.Li qmin
record consists of exactly one entry; each
.Li min
record consists of at least one and at most four entries, one for each
quarter-minute; each
.Li hour
has at most 240, etc.
.Pp
There are finite records (except for yearly ones) bound to a circular
buffer per interval.
When a record is filled, such as with four quarter-minute entries into a
minute record, the next entry creates a new record with one entry while
the oldest is discarded.
.Pp
The circular buffer is large enough for a reasonable glimpse into the
past, with emphasis placed on recent data: 40 quarter-minute records (10
minutes), 300 minute records (5 hours), 96 hourly (5 days), 28 daily (4
weeks), 104 weekly (two years), endless yearly entries.
.Pp
Each record consists of the following:
.Bd -literal
{    ctime: int,
   entries: int,
       cpu: real,
       mem: real,
     netrx: int,
     nettx: int,
  discread: int,
 discwrite: int,
    nprocs: real,
  interval: int,
        id: int }
.Ed
.Pp
Integers are serialised from 64-bit signed numbers.
Real-valued numbers are serialised from double-precision numbers.
The fields are defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Li ctime
a UNIX epoch of when the record was started (first entry)
.It Li entries
the number of entries, so front-end displays will need to average all
data by this number
.It Li cpu
average processor utilisation over all processing unit
.It Li mem
active memory over all available memory
.It Li netrx
bytes received per second over all interfaces
.It Li nettx
bytes transmitted per second over all interfaces
.It Li discread
bytes read per second over all configured devices
.It Li discwrite
bytes written per second over all configured devices
.It Li nprocs
number of running processes over all possible processes
.It Li interval
the type of interval starting with zero for quarter-minute, one fo 
minute, etc.
.It Li id
a unique record identifier

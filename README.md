## Synopsis

*slant* is a remote system monitor.  For the time being, it only works
with OpenBSD hosts.

The website has all the information you might need, and the manpages
document the system itself.

The GitHub site is for issues and pull requests: source code is
versioned in a private [BSD.lv](https://bsd.lv) repository.

If you'd like to help out, please e-mail the author.
